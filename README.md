GEDDVASVF:
- Virtual Analog State Variable Filter
- Biquad EQ replacement who's parameters can be safely automated without explosions.
- Complete with UI that displays frequency and phase responses.
- Based heavily on the juce::dsp::IIR filter.
- VASVF code taken from https://cytomic.com/technical-papers SvfLinearTrapOptimised2.pdf
- Transfer function for the UI by ollpu on The Audio Programmer discord https://dgriffin91.github.io/dsp-math-notes/one_pole_z_domain_tf.html

I am not a lawyer, I have no licencing plans for this at all, especially considering it takes from other sources who no doubt have their own licensing, use at your own risk.

Thanks,
